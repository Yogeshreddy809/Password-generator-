# Password Generator Project Report

## Introduction
This project implements a password generator tool in Python that creates strong, random passwords based on user specifications. The generator allows customization of password length and character sets.

## Features
- Customizable password length (8-64 characters)
- Option to include/exclude:
  - Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  - Digits (0-9)
  - Special characters (!@#$%^&* etc.)
- Ensures generated passwords meet specified complexity requirements

## Implementation Details
The password generator uses Python's built-in `random` and `string` modules:
- `string.ascii_letters` for alphabetic characters
- `string.digits` for numeric characters
- `string.punctuation` for special characters

The generation process:
1. Collects user requirements
2. Builds a character set based on requirements
3. Generates random passwords until one meets all complexity rules

## Security Considerations
- Uses cryptographically strong random number generation (via `random.SystemRandom` for better security)
- Enforces minimum password length of 8 characters
- Verifies password meets complexity requirements before returning

## Future Enhancements
- Add password strength meter
- Implement copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Add option to generate multiple passwords at once
- Create GUI version
